But wait — that's the Booker Prize, not the International Booker Prize. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, the question says \"the very award above for which the first book was later in contention.\" So Book A is a contender for the award, and Book B won that same award. Let me check the International Booker Prize winners in the 2010s and look for the connection. Let me search for the Wikipedia page on the International Booker Prize.",
