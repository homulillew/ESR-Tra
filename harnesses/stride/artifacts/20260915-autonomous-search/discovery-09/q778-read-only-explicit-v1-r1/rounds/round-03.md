The only thing I am interested in is to know if you're my dad.\"\n\nAccording to her birth certificate, Riette was born Mariette van Deventer in Ladysmith in eastern South Africa on August 8, 1975. Her mother was 21 when she gave birth, and there is no father named in the paperwork.\n\nRiette said her mom told her that she had gotten pregnant with her during a tryst at the Union Buildings (South Africa's Parliament).\n\n\"All she told me was that the guy had a lot of money, he had a Rolls Royce and a yacht,\" she explained. \"I believe that man was Errol because everything just fits. He was the guy with the money. He was the arrogant guy, self-entitled, self-assured. And he didn't treat women the way he was supposed to.\"\n\nAs for Gerrit, he said his mother \"was sure that Elon Musk was Riette's brother. She didn't tell me it as an absolute fact, but she had that confidence in her voice that made me believe her immediately.\"\n\nRiette added, \"Why would my mother lie to my brother? She knew she was dying, she had nothing to lose and nothing t"

The only thing I am interested in is to know if you're my dad.\"\n\nAccording to her birth certificate, Riette was born Mariette van Deventer in Ladysmith in eastern South Africa on August 8, 1975. Her mother was 21 when she gave birth, and there is no father named in the paperwork.\n\nRiette said her mom told her that she had gotten pregnant with her during a tryst at the Union Buildings (South Africa's Parliament).\n\n\"All she told me was that the guy had a lot of money, he had a Rolls Royce and a yacht,\" she explained. \"I believe that man was Errol because everything just fits. He was the guy with the money. He was the arrogant guy, self-entitled, self-assured. And he didn't treat women the way he was supposed to.\"\n\nAs for Gerrit, he said his mother \"was sure that Elon Musk was Riette's brother. She didn't tell me it as an absolute fact, but she had that confidence in her voice that made me believe her immediately.\"\n\nRiette added, \"Why would my mother lie to my brother? She knew she was dying, she had nothing to lose and nothing t"
