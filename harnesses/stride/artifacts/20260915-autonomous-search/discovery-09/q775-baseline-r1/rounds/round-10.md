But the Booker Prize was established in 1969, not the 2000s. The puzzle says \"the award itself\" was \"originally created in the 2000s.\" Let me reconsider the puzzle structure carefully.\n\nRe-reading: \"the very award above for which the first book was later in contention\" — this strongly implies the SAME award. The Man Asian Literary Prize (established 2007) fits \"created in the 2000s.\" But Obioma's books were shortlisted for the Booker Prize, not the Man Asian Literary Prize. Let me reconsider whether the puzzle might involve a different award, or whether I'm misreading. Let me search for awards created in the 2000s that Obioma's books were contenders for, and also reconsider the structure.",
