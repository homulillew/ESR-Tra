It produces and retails textiles, leather goods, and accessories.Karen M. Morin, Jeanne Kay Guelke – 2007 – Aperçu – Autres éditionsTurkey – Page 192 Rosie Ayliffe, Marc S. Dubin, Terry Richardson – 2003Istanbul City Guide\n\nVakko also operates luxury department stores under the Vakko name at Zorlu Center, İstinye Park, Akmerkez, Vadi Istanbul, and Akasya malls and on Bağdat Caddesi in Suadiye (Asian side); in Ankara at Atakule and Armada malls, and in İzmir at Hilltown and Istinye Park İzmir malls. It also operates boutiques under the Vakkorama, Vakko Couture, Vakko Wedding, Vakko L'Atelier, and Vakko Home names, as well as Vakko Outlet locations.\"Stores\", Vakko official website\n\nIn 1962, Vakko's eight-story flagship store on İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu was the first modern department store in Turkey.\"Heritage\", Vakko website It operated until 2006, when it became a branch of Mango.\"Vakko Beyoğlu'ndan gidiyor yerine en büyük Mango geliyor\" (\"Vakko leaves Beyoğlu and is replaced by the biggest Mango\"), Hürriyet, 29 June 2006\n\nHistory\n\nVakko was founded in 1934 by Vitali Hakko under the brand name Şen Şapka () as a small hat seller in Sultanhamam. In 1937, with his older brother Albert Hakko becoming a partner, Vitali Hakko changed the name of the company to Vakko and established Turkey's first silk dyeing workshop in Kurtuluş, Şişli. After Şen Şapka transformed into Vakko, it started to produce scarves with Turkish silk, cotton and wool. Over time, Vakko turned to ready-to-wear to produce more than hats, scarves, and printed fabrics. Here, customers were introduced for the first time to modern store practices such as bargain-free and promotional sales, and replacement of sold goods.\n\nIn 1962, Hakko opened a large 8-storey store, including a cafe and fashion gallery, in Beyoğlu (a.k.a. Pera), at the time, the most important modern shopping districts in Istanbul. In 1969, the first Vakko Factory was built in Merter measuring 40,000 m2 and employment was provided. In 1973, the second Vakko store opened in Ankara, and Vakko began to further expand its retail network with the Vakko Boutique sales points it opened one after the other. Six years later, in 1979, the third Vakko store opened in İzmir. There was an increase in the popularity of the Vakko brand with advertising campaigns and fashion shows carried out throughout Turkey.\n\nIn September 1979 Vakko opened up its first shop outside Turkey, in Ol"

His father worked for the railroad, his mother was a housewife preoccupied with her children. The Hakko family named their latest addition 'Vitali', or 'life'. Little Vitali got his basic education at a school run by an order of French Freres in the nearby Istanbul district of Kumkapı.\nBut he was only able to attend for six years when his father lost his job. When his father took up carpentry, little Vitali became his apprentice. He also managed to squeeze another experience into his boyhood years when, at age seven, he converted the cavernous, dark space where children played at Yedikule into a cinema – his only capital a tiny projector and the speech his big sister gave at the opening. As he was struggling to get the projector going after she finished speaking, the kerosene lamp slipped from his hand in his excitement and the film went up in flames. That's how Hakko learned to take risks in business. But this incident, which he remembered as a failure, embarrassed him terribly and he didn't go out of the house for a week. Blowing a trivial incident out of proportion instantaneously taught him the concepts of honor, character, confidence, intelligence, honesty, success and failure.By Jewish tradition, boys become 'men' at age thirteen, an occasion celebrated in a ceremony known as a 'bar mitzvah'. Realizing he was a 'man' now, after the ceremony Vitali decided he would feel guilty if he didn't start working and contributing to the family budget. Following his forays into carpentry and the cinema, he bid a firm farewell to childhood and started to work in Mahmutpaşa, Istanbul's traditional garment district. Although his job was to stand in front of a shop and say, \"Please come in\", this young man, whose commercial sense would prove ingenious in years to come, never looked down on it for a minute.\n\nForward-looking and industrious, Vitali learned all the tricks of the trade from the Mahmutpaşa merchants, all the while witnessing with growing enthusiasm the phases of reform through which the new Turkish Republic, young like himself, was passing. Swept along by the dress and headgear reform, in 1934 he opened a tiny shop called 'Şen Şapka' (Happy Hat) in Sultanhamam near Mahmutpaşa. \"If it hadn't been for the dress and hat reform,\" he would say all his life, \"there could have been no Happy Hat and no Vakko.\"\n\n\"Many businessmen of my generation claim to have started from zero. I didn't start even from zero. My starting place was a point way below zero. Nonetheless, we trained o"

It produces and retails textiles, leather goods, and accessories.Karen M. Morin, Jeanne Kay Guelke – 2007 – Aperçu – Autres éditionsTurkey – Page 192 Rosie Ayliffe, Marc S.

It also operates boutiques under the Vakkorama, Vakko Couture, Vakko Wedding, Vakko L'Atelier, and Vakko Home names, as well as Vakko Outlet locations.\"Stores\", Vakko official website\n\nIn 1962, Vakko's eight-story flagship store on İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu was the first modern department store in Turkey.\"Heritage\", Vakko website It operated until 2006, when it became a branch of Mango.\"Vakko Beyoğlu'ndan gidiyor yerine en büyük Mango geliyor\" (\"Vakko leaves Beyoğlu and is replaced by the biggest Mango\"), Hürriyet, 29 June 2006\n\nHistory\n\nVakko was founded in 1934 by Vitali Hakko under the brand name Şen Şapka () as a small hat seller in Sultanhamam. In 1937, with his older brother Albert Hakko becoming a partner, Vitali Hakko changed the name of the company to Vakko and established Turkey's first silk dyeing workshop in Kurtuluş, Şişli. After Şen Şapka transformed into Vakko, it started to produce scarves with Turkish silk, cotton and wool. Over time, Vakko turned to ready-to-wear to produce more than hats, scarves, and printed fabrics. Here, customers were introduced for the first time to modern store practices such as bargain-free and promotional sales, and replacement of sold goods.\n\nIn 1962, Hakko opened a large 8-storey store, including a cafe and fashion gallery, in Beyoğlu (a.k.a. Pera), at the time, the most important modern shopping districts in Istanbul. In 1969, the first Vakko Factory was built in Merter measuring 40,000 m2 and employment was provided. In 1973, the second Vakko store opened in Ankara, and Vakko began to further expand its retail network with the Vakko Boutique sales points it opened one after the other. Six years later, in 1979, the third Vakko store opened in İzmir. There was an increase in the popularity of the Vakko brand with advertising campaigns and fashion shows carried out throughout Turkey.\n\nIn September 1979 Vakko opened up its first shop outside Turkey, in Ol"

          "text": "---\ntitle: Vitali Hakko, the man behind the legend named Vakko\ndate: 2014-11-17\n---\nVitali Hakko, the man behind the legend named Vakko\n\nSeven years ago, when Vitali Hakko dies, Skylife – Turkish Airlines inflight magazine published his lifetime story… There are some interesting parts from this text.\n\nIt was 1913 and the world was on the brink of a great war when a boy was born in a wooden mansion in seven-hilled Istanbul's Yedikule district along the shores of the Marmara Sea. His father worked for the railroad, his mother was a housewife preoccupied with her children. The Hakko family named their latest addition 'Vitali', or 'life'. Little Vitali got his basic education at a school run by an order of French Freres in the nearby Istanbul district of Kumkapı.\nBut he was only able to attend for six years when his father lost his job. When his father took up carpentry, little Vitali became his apprentice. He also managed to squeeze another experience into his boyhood years when, at age seven, he converted the cavernous, dark space where children played at Yedikule into a cinema – his only capital a tiny projector and the speech his big sister gave at the opening. As he was struggling to get the projector going after she finished speaking, the kerosene lamp slipped from his hand in his excitement and the film went up in flames. That's how Hakko learned to take risks in business. But this incident, which he remembered as a failure, embarrassed him terribly and he didn't go out of the house for a week. Blowing a trivial incident out of proportion instantaneously taught him the concepts of honor, character, confidence, intelligence, honesty, success and failure.By Jewish tradition, boys become 'men' at age thirteen, an occasion celebrated in a ceremony known as a 'bar mitzvah'. Realizing he was a 'man' now, after the ceremony Vitali decided he would feel guilty if he didn't start working and contributing to the family budget. Following his forays into carpentry and the cinema, he bid a firm farewell to childhood and started to work in Mahmutpaşa, Istanbul's traditional garment district. Although his job was to stand in front of a shop and say, \"Please come in\", this young man, whose commercial sense would prove ingenious in years to come, never looked down on it for a minute.\n\nForward-looking and industrious, Vitali learned all the tricks of the trade from the Mahmutpaşa merchants, all the while witnessing with growing enthusiasm the phases of reform through which the new Turkish Republic, young like himself, was passing. Swept along by the dress and headgear reform, in 1934 he opened a tiny shop called 'Şen Şapka' (Happy Hat) in Sultanhamam near Mahmutpaşa. \"If it hadn't been for the dress and hat reform,\" he would say all his life, \"there could have been no Happy Hat and no Vakko.\"\n\n\"Many businessmen of my generation claim to have started from zero. I didn't start even from zero. My starting place was a point way below zero. Nonetheless, we trained o"
