The show, which was also exhibited in Rome, Vienna, Brussels, Paris, and London on outside Turkey, introduced Vakko in Europe as the representative of contemporary Turkish fashion.\n\nIn 1982, Vakkorama, one of Turkey's first youth stores, opened in Taksim, Istanbul. In order to bring New York fashion to Istanbul, Vakkorama introduced a new team called V2K Designers ('V2K Designers') in 2000 with the slogan \"Two cities, one brand\". Over time, V2K Designers has acquired designers and brands from other fashion cities such as Paris, London and Milan, as well as New York. Today, it is Turkey's first concept store where different world brands meet under the same roof. Creations of other designers and brands such as Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Alexander Wang, Hussein Chalayan, Preen, Erdem, Elizabeth & James, Band of Outsider, and Rag & Bone are available at V2K Designers.\n\nIn 2006, Vakko opened in the then-new Kanyon Shopping Mall in Levent, in Istanbul's modern Central Business District (the store has since closed and opened in the newer, larger Zorlu Center nearby). At the same time, the famous fashion designer Zac Posen's specially interpreted creations for Vakko were introduced under the label \"Zac Posen @Vakko\". In the same year, world-famous top model Gisele Bündchen became the face of Vakko's campaign. Since 2008, Vakko has been continuing its operations in its new factory, which is headquartered in Merter and spread over an area 2 times the size of its old factory, with screen printing and ready-made clothing production units, logistics facilities, social use areas, and work offices.\n\nIn 2009, Vakko Home, launched, offering a selection of home furnishings and accessories, domestics (bed linens and towels), etc.\n\nIn 2010, Vakko Fashion Center, designed by New York-based REX and shared with media company Power Media, was opened in Nakkaştepe, Üsküdar (Asia), consisting of all management units and creative staff offices, as well as showrooms, the Vitali Hakko Creative Industries Library, auditorium, gallery and museum. In the same year, Vakko Wedding House Akaretler, which brings together evening dresses, tuxedos, accessories, underwear and hats suitable for all kinds of ceremonies for the bride and groom's families, opened in a single store. The first culture and arts festival, Istancool, which brought together many famous artists from different disciplines, was held in 2010. Many important names from the fashion and art worlds were hosted as guests, including the famous style icon Daphne Guinness, hat designer Philip Treacy, and pianist Michael Nyman. In 2011, Vakko Fashion Center was chosen as the \"Best Workspace "

We were the first generation of the young Republic and it was Ataturk's reforms that spurred us on.\"\n\nThe Vakko brand name, which combines the first initials of Vitali and his brother Albert's names with the last three letters of their surname, would be synonymous with fashion in Turkey for years to come. The slogan, 'Fashion Is Vakko', used in their advertising campaigns for years confirmed this.\nBack in the days when raw silk was still sent to France to be printed, Vitali Hakko created scarves that could be considered works of art using Anatolian cottons and Bursa silks. He also turned the designs of prominent artists such as painter and poet Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu into scarves. In 1948 he set up Turkey's first factory for printing cloth in the district of Kurtuluş in Istanbul's European sector, where scarves bearing the Vakko label are still produced today. By the fifties, Hakko realized that he was not going to be able satisfy his love of fashion simply with scarves.\n\nWith his quick mind and his perception of fashion as an integral whole, he decided to introduce ready-to-wear in Turkey. His chief competitors were the numerous neighborhood tailors and dressmakers that made clothes to order.Coming out ahead in the competition, he organized the first style show in the history of fashion in Turkey.It was 1955, Ottoman motifs entered his life around the same time when he began to incorporate into his fabrics motifs from the traditional Ottoman arts of calligraphy, illumination and paper marbling that impressed him at the Topkapı Palace.\nIn 1962, when no lady would be caught dead without a hat and no gentleman without a 'cravatte' in Beyoğlu, Hakko opened his first big store here. Later he would bring his great love for this district, his 'prolonged love affair' as he put it, to the Society for the Beautification of Beyoğlu, of which he was one of the founders. In this store, whose sign read 'Vakko', shoppers would also encounter for the first time concepts such as 'no bargaining', 'regular discounts', and 'no returns or exchanges'.\n\nIn 1969 he would take Vakko, which he had nurtured with his own hands, to an innovative factory in Merter, an outlying industrial area on the road to the airport. Fashion and art went hand in hand here at the factory, which was filled with paintings and sculptures by prominent Turkish artists.\nHakko's love of art was unquenchable and found further expression in the art galleries he opened at his stores. Further expanding Vakko in the seventies, Vitali Hakko also took the store to Ankara and Izmir, and in 1982 created a new brand together with his son Cem. Called Vakkorama, this chic new youth trademark was a dynamic entity that combined style, fashion, art, music and sports.\n\nI can't paint,\" he would say, \"but I can spot a scarf or necktie whose pattern or color I believe will make pe"

The show, which was also exhibited in Rome, Vienna, Brussels, Paris, and London on outside Turkey, introduced Vakko in Europe as the representative of contemporary Turkish fashion.\n\nIn 1982, Vakkorama, one of Turkey's first youth stores, opened in Taksim, Istanbul. In order to bring New York fashion to Istanbul, Vakkorama introduced a new team called V2K Designers ('V2K Designers') in 2000 with the slogan \"Two cities, one brand\". Over time, V2K Designers has acquired designers and brands from other fashion cities such as Paris, London and Milan, as well as New York. Today, it is Turkey's first concept store where different world brands meet under the same roof. Creations of other designers and brands such as Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Alexander Wang, Hussein Chalayan, Preen, Erdem, Elizabeth & James, Band of Outsider, and Rag & Bone are available at V2K Designers.\n\nIn 2006, Vakko opened in the then-new Kanyon Shopping Mall in Levent, in Istanbul's modern Central Business District (the store has since closed and opened in the newer, larger Zorlu Center nearby). At the same time, the famous fashion designer Zac Posen's specially interpreted creations for Vakko were introduced under the label \"Zac Posen @Vakko\". In the same year, world-famous top model Gisele Bündchen became the face of Vakko's campaign. Since 2008, Vakko has been continuing its operations in its new factory, which is headquartered in Merter and spread over an area 2 times the size of its old factory, with screen printing and ready-made clothing production units, logistics facilities, social use areas, and work offices.\n\nIn 2009, Vakko Home, launched, offering a selection of home furnishings and accessories, domestics (bed linens and towels), etc.\n\nIn 2010, Vakko Fashion Center, designed by New York-based REX and shared with media company Power Media, was opened in Nakkaştepe, Üsküdar (Asia), consisting of all management units and creative staff offices, as well as showrooms, the Vitali Hakko Creative Industries Library, auditorium, gallery and museum. In the same year, Vakko Wedding House Akaretler, which brings together evening dresses, tuxedos, accessories, underwear and hats suitable for all kinds of ceremonies for the bride and groom's families, opened in a single store. The first culture and arts festival, Istancool, which brought together many famous artists from different disciplines, was held in 2010. Many important names from the fashion and art worlds were hosted as guests, including the famous style icon Daphne Guinness, hat designer Philip Treacy, and pianist Michael Nyman. In 2011, Vakko Fashion Center was chosen as the \"Best Workspace "

We were the first generation of the young Republic and it was Ataturk's reforms that spurred us on.\"\n\nThe Vakko brand name, which combines the first initials of Vitali and his brother Albert's names with the last three letters of their surname, would be synonymous with fashion in Turkey for years to come. The slogan, 'Fashion Is Vakko', used in their advertising campaigns for years confirmed this.\nBack in the days when raw silk was still sent to France to be printed, Vitali Hakko created scarves that could be considered works of art using Anatolian cottons and Bursa silks. He also turned the designs of prominent artists such as painter and poet Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu into scarves. In 1948 he set up Turkey's first factory for printing cloth in the district of Kurtuluş in Istanbul's European sector, where scarves bearing the Vakko label are still produced today. By the fifties, Hakko realized that he was not going to be able satisfy his love of fashion simply with scarves.\n\nWith his quick mind and his perception of fashion as an integral whole, he decided to introduce ready-to-wear in Turkey. His chief competitors were the numerous neighborhood tailors and dressmakers that made clothes to order.Coming out ahead in the competition, he organized the first style show in the history of fashion in Turkey.It was 1955, Ottoman motifs entered his life around the same time when he began to incorporate into his fabrics motifs from the traditional Ottoman arts of calligraphy, illumination and paper marbling that impressed him at the Topkapı Palace.\nIn 1962, when no lady would be caught dead without a hat and no gentleman without a 'cravatte' in Beyoğlu, Hakko opened his first big store here. Later he would bring his great love for this district, his 'prolonged love affair' as he put it, to the Society for the Beautification of Beyoğlu, of which he was one of the founders. In this store, whose sign read 'Vakko', shoppers would also encounter for the first time concepts such as 'no bargaining', 'regular discounts', and 'no returns or exchanges'.\n\nIn 1969 he would take Vakko, which he had nurtured with his own hands, to an innovative factory in Merter, an outlying industrial area on the road to the airport. Fashion and art went hand in hand here at the factory, which was filled with paintings and sculptures by prominent Turkish artists.\nHakko's love of art was unquenchable and found further expression in the art galleries he opened at his stores. Further expanding Vakko in the seventies, Vitali Hakko also took the store to Ankara and Izmir, and in 1982 created a new brand together with his son Cem. Called Vakkorama, this chic new youth trademark was a dynamic entity that combined style, fashion, art, music and sports.\n\nI can't paint,\" he would say, \"but I can spot a scarf or necktie whose pattern or color I believe will make pe"
