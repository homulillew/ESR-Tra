Let me re-read the puzzle:\n\n- Book A: contender for award, translated into 25+ languages, published in the 2010s\n- In the year Book A was published, another book (Book B) which had been released the preceding year won the award\n- Author of Book B was born in the city where Author of Book A grew up\n- Question: where was Author of Book A born?\n\nThe International Booker Prize (reconfigured 2016) awards a book published in the preceding year. Let me look at the Wikipedia page for the International Booker Prize directly to see the winners and structure.",
